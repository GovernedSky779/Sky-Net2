		<h3>Values and Motives</h3>
	<p>Many people call me an idealist due to my constant habit of trying to see the best of the situation, though I am aware of other factors affecting an outcome. I am not ignorant of the possiblity of a worst case senario, but I believe that mindset often breeds that outcome as people may lose their dedication and motivation to the fear of failure
	The one lesson about failure that I hold beyond all else is that it can be avoided mostly but not entirely. Failing is part of the process of improving, and that in order to learn the most from failure to see as to why that group or individual failed. By recognizing cause and affect by objectivly looking the process leading to the fall is something that
	everyone should learn how to do. In simpler terms, learn from your mistakes and take responsibility for it. Reminding ones self to be humble through remembrance of past failures and mistakes, has always been something I have tried to practice and teach. As it is only when people are equal do they understand each other best.
